*I'll divide it into sections (per week) to make it easier to navigate*

## WEEK 01
### 1. [Bash Scripting Tutorial for Beginner](https://youtu.be/tK9Oc6AEnR4?si=PgCeVxj2v0PJ4KMx)
As a beginner, I think this video helps me a lot to learn how to use Bash since basically Bash is the essential of the Unix/Linux command-line shell. The video's OP clearly demonstrates how each syntax work.
### 2. [How to create a file in Linux using the bash terminal](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/create-a-file-in-linux-using-the-bash-shell-terminal/)
This link explains the basics on how we utilize Terminal to create text files. It shows various commands to create, view, edit, and append text files directly on the Linux terminal. The steps shown are really clear and easy-to-follow, plus the creator also puts illustrations on how each command will work.
### 3. [Week01: Overview 2, Virtualization & Scripting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFjdbPBNbto)
Taken from the SOSI lecture, the recording really helps me in doing the Week 01 quiz and understanding how virtualization and Bash actually works. It has a lots of key points, including materials that haven't been deeply covered in the OS lecture. Both SOSI and OS have similar discussion topic, thus it can be an additional supplementary throughout the OS lecture.
### 4. [How To Use SCP To Transfer Files Between A Mac And A Linux Server](https://www.systranbox.com/how-to-use-scp-to-transfer-files-between-a-mac-and-a-linux-server/)
Since I used a MacBook Pro throughout this lecture, my biggest concern is I need to learn how can I use SCP in Mac (it's slightly different from the Windows one). This article is easy to follow and provides a helpful tutorial regarding SCP between MacOS and Linux.

## BONUS
### [TXT - Do It Like That](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0EYKxF1oTI)
TXT also exists as a real-life music group, not just a file type! This TXT stands for Tomorrow X Together. Go check their music, pretty uplifting!
